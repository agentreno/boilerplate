My web app boilerplate based on HTML5 boilerplate using initializr with some 
personal preferences.

To use Bower to install new Javascript dependencies and automatically link 
them in index.html, first install bower and wiredep, then just use bower 
install:

```
npm install -g bower wiredep
bower install jquery -S
```
